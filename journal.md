# July 8th
I created the schematic for the business card, and the MCU.

Couldn't find a good USB c footprint so I had to use a different library

**Total time spent: 2 Hours**
# July 9th
I made the PCB, and got it wired up, I'll add the silkscreen after I eat lunch

Done! I added the buttons and the details (my phone number is on there too, but I redacted for obvious reasons)
